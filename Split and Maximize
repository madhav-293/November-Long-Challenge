Let ff be a function, such that, for an array AA of size MM, f(A)f(A) is defined as

f(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{M}\sum_{j=1, j \ne i}^{j=M} (A_i\cdot A_j)f(A)=∑

You are given an array CC of size NN. In one operation on the array, you can:

Choose an index ii (1\le i \le |C|)(1≤i≤∣C∣)
Select two positive integers XX and YY such that X+Y = C_iX+Y=C 
i
​
 
Remove the element C_iC 
i
​
  from the array CC
Insert the elements XX and YY to the array CC
Find the maximum value of f(C)f(C) that can be obtained using any (possibly zero) number of given operations. Since this value can be huge, output the answer modulo 998244353998244353.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, denoting the size of the array.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_NC

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum value of f(C)f(C) that can be obtained using any (possibly zero) number of given operations. Since this value can be huge, output the answer modulo 998244353998244353.
