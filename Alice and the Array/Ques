Alice is playing a game with permutations of size NN.

She selects a random permutation PP of size NN and a random index ii (1\le i \le N)(1≤i≤N);
She keeps incrementing the index ii until:
The next element is greater than the current element (P_{(i+1)} > P_i)(P 
(i+1)
​
 >P 
i
​
 ), or;
She reaches the last index (i = N)(i=N).
Find the expected number of indices that Alice will visit throughout the game.

It can be shown that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction \frac{P}{Q}

 , where PP and QQ are coprime integers, P \ge 0, Q \gt 0P≥0,Q>0 and QQ is coprime with 10^9 + 710

Note that a permutation of size NN consists of all integers from 11 to NN, where each element is present exactly once.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of single lines of input containing an integer NN, the size of permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, print in a single line, the expected number of indices that Alice will visit throughout the game.

Explanation:
Test case 11: There is only one possible way to select a permutation of size 11 and an index from the permutation 11. Thus, we choose P = \{1\}P={1} and i = 1i=1. The number of indices covered after this choice is 11.

Test case 22: The possible cases are:

P = \{1, 2\}P={1,2} and i = 1i=1: We cannot increment the index i=1i=1 as P_2 \gt P_1P 
2
​
 >P 
1
​
 . Thus, number of indices covered is 11.
P = \{1, 2\}P={1,2} and i = 2i=2: We cannot increment the index i=2i=2 as it is the last index. Thus, number of indices covered is 11.
P = \{2, 1\}P={2,1} and i = 1i=1: We can increment the index i=1i=1 as P_2 \lt P_1P 
2
​
 <P 
1
​
 . We reach index i = 2i=2. Now we cannot increment the index. Thus, number of indices covered is 22.
P = \{2, 1\}P={2,1} and i = 2i=2: We cannot increment the index i=2i=2 as it is the last index. Thus, number of indices covered is 11.
