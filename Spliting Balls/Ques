There are NN balls in a bag. Initially, the i^{th}i 
th
  ball has a number A_iA 
i
​
  on it.

In one second, a ball with number kk (k>1)(k>1), dissociates into kk balls, where each of the kk balls has number (k-1)(k−1) written on it.
If k = 1k=1, there is no change on the state of the ball.

Find the number of balls in the bag after 10^{100}10 
100
  seconds. Since the final number of balls can be huge, output the answer modulo 10^9+710 
9
 +7.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, denoting the number of balls in the bag.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_NA

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of balls in the bag after 10^{100}10 
100
  seconds. Since the final number of balls can be huge, output the answer modulo 10^9+710
